This App regroups some of the projects I have done for fun and by curiosity


## Script sheet
```
npm start
```
Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in the browser.

```
npm run build
```
Builds the React App for production in the ui/build folder. 

## Heroku deployment
Create an Heroku App and link your repository to it. You can then choose to do Automatic deploys depending on a branch.
I strongly advise to create a second app for your integration branch.
